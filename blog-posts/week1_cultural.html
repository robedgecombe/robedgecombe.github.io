	<p>Unfortunately the blog template is not part of my repertoire as of yet, but when it is I will copy and paste it in.</P>
		<p> I have just watched the video, and I can see what I already knew, that this is going to be a period of intensive learning and it is going to challenge me in many different ways. I am looking forward to it, but also grateful for the fact that there is the phase 0 at the beginning which will give me the time to learn a lot of the 'scales' from the outset, so hopefully by the time the contact time begins I will be on the right wavelength. I am in a fortunate position where I will be able to dedicate the time towards it during phase 0 as I don't have that many other commitments at the moment, and when phase 1 begins I should be in the right frame of mind. At the moment I am feeling a little burnt out, this is because I spent so much time on it in the last week and still didn't really learn everything. I don't know how to link CSS to an HTML page yet, and blog templates I haven't even started. Git makes some sense, but there are 53 pages in that lab and I've only done 11 of them, one of which didn't work. So I can identify with the person who was asking about rabbit holes - how deep versus how wide. I guess I am going to have to figure out a lot of that for myself, but I imagine through the pairing and this kind of thing it will become a little more clear for me. <br>
			The concept of the program itself, however, makes sense and I like it. I am mildly concerned that the 'kitchen mentality' is another way of bluffing his way through the fact that the course is still relatively new and not finalised yet, but its OK and I have studied before - if you don't work hard then you're not going to get anything out of it. You can't expect stuff to be handed to you on a silver plate. Additionally, I can identify with the analogy to music - learning the basics is like learning scales. You have to do it, but you might as well do it alone, so that when you get to spend time with some experienced people you can really get some proper jamming done. That is good for me, when I was studying jazz they always used to say 'learn this stuff so that you can forget it', it was annoying at the time but afterwards it made sense. The stuff you learn goes in, then comes out when you are playing. I think it is probably quite similar here. </p>
			<p>Anyhow so all in all I am enthusiastic, but a bit nervous at the same time. Really glad that I have a couple months before phase 1 begins, so that I can dedicate some time towards learning. Once I get a system going, it should be good.</p>
