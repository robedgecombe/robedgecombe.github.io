		<h1>Websites I have visited</h1>
		<h2><a href=http://davematthewsband.com/>davematthewsband.com</a></h2>
		<p>Interesting aspects of this website </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Slick homepage</li>
			<li>Informative about the band</li>
			<li>Makes them look good</li>
			<li>You can listen to some of their music on it</li>
			<li>Easy to navigate around it</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I would say that this is a good website due to the fact that as it is for a band, there is a requirement that it portray the image that the band wants it to. It is essentially an advertisement for the band. The homepage is clear, not too cluttered, and the eye is drawn towards their upcoming tour and recently released material. - There is a window which changes, catching the eye, and if you click on it at the appropriate time you will either be watching a video, taken to a ticketing website or another website to buy some merchandise. However, this does not detract from the overal vibe of the website, which is important as if it is the first time you stumbled upon their website then it is important that you get the right impression. They need to cater for current fans and potential fans, so the first impression counts. On the music tab they have all of their albums, and a link to each song playing a snippet. You can purchase the album as well. There is a nice balance between making the website look sharp and also making it possible to buy stuff, which in my opinion is very clever.</p></section>
		<section id="Margins-Borders-Padding">
			<h1>Margins, Borders, Padding</h1>
			<h2>what's the difference?</h2>
			<p>Well, these three properties are all to do with the outlines of the section. However, the difference lies in exactly which part of the outline you are referring to.<br> <b>Padding</b> is what goes on inside the section. Maybe you have some text in there, or a picture. If set the margins at 20px top, 20px bottom, 10px right and 10px left, then you know that there is going to be a gap between the top of the picture and the border of 20px. Likewise, this will take place between the bottom of the picture, and the sides. <br>
				The <b>border</b> of course is the actual edging of the section. You can define the border, make it bold or double-lined, or dashed. You can see it.<br> 
				Finally we have the <b>margin</b>, which defines the gap between the section itself and the rest of the page. So you can set the margin pixellation, in much the same way as you did the padding, and it will define where the section sits.</p></section>
