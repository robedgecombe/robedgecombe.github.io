		<h1>The Gregorc Thinking Style</h1>
<p>Well, I sat the Gregorc test, and the only real definite answer that came out of it was that I am definitely not Concrete Sequential. All the other three I had traces of, most notably Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential. Having had a look at what the qualities are, it's really hard to see. I can always see a bit of myself in everything, and this applies here as well. Concrete Sequential would definitely be the one that I least can identify with, so it is cool that it came last, by quite a long way. The other ones apply in different situations. When I am in a really creative frame of mind, then the Abstract Sequential side of me comes in to play. I use my skills to get the best results, and work well with other people who understand where I am coming from. It is frustrating in these moments to have to deal with people who disagree, or don't get where I am coming from. I need people to understand me, and that is that. In such a situation I can be a bit driven, and tend to take over. However, in my defence I would say that I only really get like this when I am working on something that I am fully confident in my abilities on. I don't think that we will be seeing much of this during the course, because I am such a novice at everything this course has to offer.</p>
<br>
<p>Concrete Random, this is the side of me which will come to the fore for most of this course, I would say. At least for the phase 0 section. Perhaps when I have a better grasp on everything and know the people in my cohort a bit better, start working with them we will see the Abstract Sequential side of my style come out. But in the meantime I am most likely to be messing around with the whole thing, trying to figure out how it works.</p>
<br>
<p>The Abstract Random aspect of me is mostly something I have developed over the years, perhaps as I have matured a little bit and as an antidote to the Abstract Sequential side of me, which tends to lead to arguments. I think that it is good to have a balance of this, especially when working on someone else's brainwave. It's not all about me and my ideas, and I think that you can learn a lot from trying to understand where someone else is coming from, rather than trying to get others to understand where you are coming from.</p>
<p>Talk about rambling! It's Friday afternoon haha. I think the biggest struggle for me so far has been the sheer volume of learning, and the fact that it is so new. I feel pressure to get through the workload, but at the same time you have to do tons of reading for each thing. So there is this tension - you need to read the stuff, but in doing so you feel like you are wasting your time because you should be doing the activity. It has been better this week though, although I have still got quite a few issues with git. I am excited about JavaScript though, and want to get in to that more.</p>

<h2>Growth vs Fixed mindset</h2>
<p>To be honest, I've been thinking about that quite a lot over the last few weeks. I think as humans we tend towards a fixed mindset, but we need to constantly challenge that. Am I really an expert in that field? Can others not be experts too? Is this something that I am not good at? Does it have to be like that for the rest of my life? I have never considered myself a 'computer' kind of guy, but I think that this was an example of the fixed mindset. I have always considered myself pretty intelligent though - also fixed mindset - but now I am putting both of those to the test, and in order to do it I need to adopt a growth mindset. If I'm so smart, then I should be able to figure this out, right, even though it's brand new? But you need to humble yourself completely if you want to learn anything, and I am comfortable with that. Maybe <em>because</em> it is so new. I'm completely stepping out into the unknown.</p>
