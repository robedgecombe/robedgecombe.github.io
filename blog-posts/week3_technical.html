		<h1>Why is JavaScript so popular</h1>
		<ul><li>It is considered pretty easy to learn</li>
			<li>It has libraries for everything</li>
			<li>Every browser supports it</li>
			<li>It can be used to provide offline functionality</li>
			<li>It is fast, and reduces the load on the server. This is because it is a Document Object Model, meaning that everything is done on the 'client side' rather than the 'server side'. I believe that means it is possible to do front end work on it, as it is in the web development tools section of most browsers</li>
			<li>It is easy to edit - as it is just text you do not need any software or a compiler - it does not need to be compiled</li>
			<li>It is a prototyping language, very flexible and allows for objects to be built on the fly for specific purposes</li>
			<li>It is easy to debug. Once again this would be due to its being in the web developer toolbar</li>
			<li>You can use it for Object Orientated Programming, although it does not force you to do so. </li>
			<li>It is compatible with HTML, HTML5, CSS3, and AJAX</li>
			<li>With Node.js, it even means that it is now possible to  work with it on the server end as well. This is most notable on google chrome, which worked the modern version of javascript into its browser coding. They came up with the V8 JavaScript runtime engine, and when you combine this with the fact that JavaScript is asynchronous, servers are way more powerful now when it comes to serving up pages, and decreases the chances of the computer getting a Denial of Service attack, which is similar to a virus I believe.</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>What are some of JavaScript's limitations</h2>
	<ul><li>Although it would seem that google chrome is figuring out ways to get around this, given the last point above, it is generally the case that JavaScript requires a 'server side script' to write to files on the server, or access data bases. It also requires Ajax.</li>
		<li>JavaScript cannot close a window that it didn't open. For security reaasons, apparently</li>
		<li>JavaScript cannot access web pages on another domain. You can have two pages open on the same browser (on different tabs) but the JavaScript on one only works for that one, not the other. This, once again, is for security reasons I believe. It would have to do an Ajax call to your server to get it.</li>
		<li>It is possible for someone to save the decrypted copy of your page source, and JavaScript cannot protect you from this.</li>
	</ul>

<footer><h5>Well there are some things. If I am honest, I do not understand one hundred per cent of all that. I think I need to spend a bit more time working with JavaScript to get a clearer idea of its place within the world wide web. It is coming to me, but I just need more time. I have no idea what Ajax is either, but it is cool.</h5></footer>
