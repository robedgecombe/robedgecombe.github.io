		<h1>Pairing</h1>
		<p>Pairing has been a bit of a problem on this course so far - a couple times I have tried to do it with someone but not been able to get anyone, I think the problem is that we don't know each other and no one feels all that confident with the material. I paired with George Norris yesterday, as a spin off after the guided pairing session, and this was the first time we had done one without a tutor there as well. So that was good, and I think helpful as well. I tend to learn something every time I chat with someone about it, because there are certain things that people just instinctively understand that I didn't get until they said it - such as those || mean index, or list. I didn't understand that until George said it. Although, I still don't understand it. So there are positives in pairing, but I guess the problem is that we are all working at different speeds and it is difficult to get someone at the right moment, who is at the same place as you. At the moment the course is quite overwhelming, so perhaps the idea of working with someone else who also has absolutely no idea what's going on is not all that appealing for either person!</p>
		<p>I think that we will get better at it as the course goes along though. I am starting to get to know a few of the people on it now, and this will make things easier to do, also when we are all more confident with Ruby then people will generally be more enthusiastic about working together. It will get better, I think it is already starting to.</p>
